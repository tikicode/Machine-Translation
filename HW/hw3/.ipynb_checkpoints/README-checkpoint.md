# Machine Translation Assignment

This repository contains two Python programs along with supporting modules for machine translation assignment. You can use the following commands:

1. **Decode**: Translates input sentences from French to English.
   - Usage: `python decode [-h]`
   - Example: `python decode < input_file.txt`

2. **Grade**: Computes the model score of a translated sentence.
   - Usage: `python grade [-h]`
   - Example: `python grade < translation_file.txt`

These commands can be used in a pipeline, for example:

```bash
python decode < input_file.txt | python grade
```

## Module: `model.py`

The `model.py` module implements simple interfaces for language models and translation models, simplifying the implementation of translation algorithms. You can use these interfaces without the need for modifications.

## Data Directory

The `data` directory contains various files derived from the Canadian Hansards dataset, which was originally aligned by Ulrich Germann:

- `input`: Contains French sentences that need to be translated.

- `tm`: Stores a phrase-based translation model, where each line follows the format:
    ```
    French phrase ||| English phrase ||| log_10(translation_prob)
    ```

- `lm`: Contains a trigram language model file in ARPA format:
    ```
    log_10(ngram_prob)   ngram   log_10(backoff_prob)
    ```

These language and translation models are computed from data in the `align` directory, utilizing alignments generated by the Berkeley aligner.

## Additional Files

- `decode-ext`: The best-performing file with future cost implementation, with a score of approximately -1300.

- `decode-beam-search`: Contains the beam search implementation.

- `translations`: Includes translated sentences generated from the future cost implementation using the following command:
  ```bash
  python decode-ext < input_file.txt > translations
  ```

You can complete the assignment without modifying this file.
